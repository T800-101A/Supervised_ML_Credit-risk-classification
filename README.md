# Supervised_ML_Credit-risk-classification
Train and Evaluate a model based on loan risk. Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets 


    Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame. 
    
    Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
    
    Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split. 

## Create a Logistic Regression Model 

    Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train). 
    Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model. 

## Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:

    Generate a confusion matrix. 
    
    Generate a classification report. 

    How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

    Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis. 
    
    Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model. 
    
    Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
